# Windows-tools

A batch script to install useful programs on Windows machines.

For the most part, this script wraps around a pre-selected list of apps on Ninite.

To use this program, run `Install Main Software.bat`

Not all software is included in the script. If you want those programs, manually click on the links and download them.

Feel free to suggest changes by making a fork and pull request in GitHub!
